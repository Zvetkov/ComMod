# ANN003 disabled for kwarg type annotations, flet's UserControls don't easily allow that
# ANN204 (return annotation for __init__) disabled as Pyright doesn't care
# TC002, 003 disabled to decrease complexity of imports
# COM812 is giving false positives on multiline string concatenation
# TD and FIX disabled in a single developer context, as all responsibility is on him
# DTZ005 is useless in context when TZ is local and datetime used for short timing
# T201, S605\6 - 'print' and os.system("cls") are extensively used in cli version of the app
# TRY400 - our usage of logging.error doesn't require impicitly provided traceback 

# PTH - not a pathlib evangelist and most of these are not hard truths, maybe consider later on
# ERA001 - remove ignore and fix on next version after 3.0
