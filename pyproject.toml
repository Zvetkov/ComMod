# D1 disabled for philosophical reason, hard docstrings requirement is debatable
# ANN101, ANN102 are disabled as type checkers can infer this automatically
# TCH *2, *3 disabled to decrease complexity of imports
# COM812 is giving false positives on multiline string concatenation
# TD and FIX disabled in a single developer context, as all responsibility is on him
# DTZ005 is useless in context when TZ is local and datetime used for short timing
# T201, S605\6 - 'print' and os.system("cls") are extensively used in cli version of the app
# TRY400 - our usage of logging.error is not requiring to impicitly provide traceback 

# PTH - not a pathlib evangelist and most of these are not hard truths, maybe consider later on
# ERA001 - remove ignore and fix on next version after 2.1

# ARG001, ARG002 - we have dosens of cases when ft.ControlEvent is passes implicitly by flet in signals, need to think
